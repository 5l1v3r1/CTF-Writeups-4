1. No libc provided so leak some addresses off the stack
2. Use the format string vulnerability to leak the stack canary from the stack as well as a libc address from the stack
3. Use the buffer overflow vulnerability to hijack program execution and jump to a one gadget in libc


136bytes + 8byte_stack_canary + 8byte_saved_ebp + return_address.
the address at offset 2 is always libc_base_address + 0x3c6780
value at offset 15 is the stack canary (by checking xor rcx, QWORD PTR fs:0x28)
