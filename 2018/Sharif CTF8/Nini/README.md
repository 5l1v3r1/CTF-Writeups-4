We use Google Search by Image to search about the person. We come up with **مريم ميرزاخاني و همسرش**. We then use Google Translate to get the text in English(it's in Persian). We get **Maryam Mirzakhan**. On searching for her, we know that she won the **Fields Medal** in 2014. So, as per the question, the flag is SharifCTF{md5('fields medal')}, which is `SharifCTF{537cd12c5f65d15dd11cc5d7f27127a8}`.
